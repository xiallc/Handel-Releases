; Abstract: Windows INF for boards with PLX chips
;
;===========================================================


;===================================================================
; SHIPPING YOUR PRODUCT
;
; Please note that all of the IDs in this INF are reserved for use
; by PLX, as are all IDs with a Vendor ID of 10B5. If you need to
; ship a product, it must be assigned a unique ID. Please refer to the
; PLX SDK Release Notes for additional details in the section entitled
; "Designating a Device ID before Shipping a Product with a PLX chip".
;===================================================================


;===================================================================
; NOTES:
;
; This file is provided by PLX to install PLX drivers for PLX
; Reference Design Boards.  It may be used by others for reference
; purposes.  For those interested in modifying it for their own
; purposes, it is recommended that you refer to the Microsoft Windows
; Driver Kit (WDK) documentation, which contains all the information
; to create and modify INF files.  At the time of this writing, the
; Windows WDK was available from http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/wdk.
;
;
; WINDOWS 8/Server 2012 & Beyond
; ------------------------------
; With the introduction of Windows 8, Microsoft now requires a digitally
; signed CATalog file (eg PlxSdk.cat) to be included with INF files.
; In the past, users were able to modify the PLX INF for their designs
; with PLX chips. With the new requirements, any modifications to the
; INF will invalidate the PLX-supplied CATalog file & prevent driver
; loading. If the INF must be modified, please obtain a Kernel-Mode
; Code Signing (KMCS) certificate to digitally sign your package. PLX
; driver binaries are already digitally signed by PLX. Please refer
; to the Windows WDK for additional information.
;
;
; ADDING AN ENTRY FOR OEM/CUSTOM DEVICES
; --------------------------------------
; For those interested in simply adding an entry for their custom
; board with a custom ID, and planning to use the PLX SDK supplied
; driver, follow the simple steps below.  Note that additional
; changes may be required depending upon the device type and any
; other requirements of custom drivers, etc.  Refer to the
; Windows WDK for additional information regarding changes.
;
; To add a custom device, in the [PLX.Mfg] section, add an entry
; similar to the existing entries according to the following:
;
;  "<My Device Name>" = DDInstall_<PLX_Chip>, PCI\VEN_<Vxxx>&DEV_<Dxxx>
;
;  where:
;
;    <My Device Name> = Name of device as it will appear in the
;                       Windows Device Manager.
;
;    <PLX_Chip>       = A supported PLX chip type, such as 9054 or 9656.
;                       This INF file already contains installation
;                       sections for currently supported PLX chips,
;                       assuming the PLX supplied driver will be used.
;
;    <Vxxx>           = The Vendor ID of your device.  An ID is
;                       assigned to each member of the PCI SIG.
;                       10B5 is assigned to and reserved for use by
;                       PLX Technology.
;
;    <Dxxx>           = The Device ID of your device.  Each vendor is
;                       responsible to managing their own Device IDs.
;                       PLX maintains a list of all IDs associated with
;                       a Vendor ID of 10B5.  The list in this INF file
;                       contains IDs of supported PLX RDKs and the
;                       default IDs of PLX chips.
;
;
; ADDING AN ENTRY FOR PLX-ASSIGNED SUBSYSTEM ID
; ---------------------------------------------
; If you have obtained a PLX-assigned Subsystem ID for shipping your
; product, then you should create an INF entry to include this ID.
; The PCI Dev/Ven ID should remain as the default & the SUBSYS_xxx
; tag added to further identify your device.
;
; For example, if PLX assigns a subsystem ID of 3D04h for your design
; containing a PLX 9656 chip, the INF entry would be similar to:
;
;  "ACME Video Decoder" = DDInstall_9656, PCI\VEN_10b5&DEV_9656&SUBSYS_3D0410B5
